When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

a remote repository is useful when
working on a project that you intend
to share or colaborate on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If more than one person are working on the same
part of the code, they may interfere with each
other's work if Git is automatically pulling
each new commit.
